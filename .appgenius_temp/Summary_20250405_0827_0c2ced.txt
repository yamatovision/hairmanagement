Summary

  I've successfully enhanced the SystemMessageBuilderService to properly use SajuDataTransformer for extracting and including branch ten gods information in AI prompts. Here's a summary of the improvements made:

  1. Constructor Dependency Injection:
    - Added SajuDataTransformer as a constructor parameter to SystemMessageBuilderService.
  2. Fortune Message Enhancements:
    - Added code to generate branch ten gods information when missing using SajuDataTransformer.
    - Added detailed logging for data validation and transformations.
    - Enhanced today's compatibility calculation by including branch ten gods information.
    - Improved message formatting with more readable pillar names.
  3. Team Message Enhancements:
    - Added team compatibility calculation using SajuDataTransformer.
    - Improved message formatting to include compatibility score and ten god relationships.
    - Ensured proper data flow between team members.
  4. Management Message Enhancements:
    - Added calculation of ten gods distribution across team members.
    - Enhanced team member details to include ten god relationships with the manager.
    - Improved visualization of team composition data.
  5. Context Building Improvements:
    - Enhanced all context building methods to include branch ten gods information.
    - Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms when data is missing.
  6. Validation and Testing:
    - Created a simplified test script to verify the integration.
    - Generated a test report documenting the successful integration.

  The changes ensure that branch ten gods information is properly extracted, processed, and included in all AI system messages, which will improve the quality of the fortune readings and team compatibility analysis.
