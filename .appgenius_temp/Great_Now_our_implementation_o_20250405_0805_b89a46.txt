Great! Now our implementation of the SajuDataTransformer service and its integration with the rest of the system is complete. This implementation enhances the data flow between services, providing a more consistent and robust
  way to handle saju data transformations across the system.

  To summarize what we've accomplished:

  1. Created a new SajuDataTransformer class to centralize the conversion of saju data between different services
  2. Integrated it with the DI container
  3. Updated the DailyCalendarInfoService to use our new transformer
  4. Updated the DailyFortuneService to use both our new transformer and the enhanced DailyCalendarInfoService
  5. Improved compatibility score calculations using our new transformer
  6. Added better error handling and fallback mechanisms

  This implementation has successfully addressed the requirements for Phase 2: Data Flow Enhancement by:

  1. Standardizing the format of saju data across different services
  2. Centralizing the calculation of ten gods relationships and other saju-related conversions
  3. Creating a more robust system for compatibility calculations
  4. Improving the connection between DailyCalendarInfo and Fortune entities

  The code is now more maintainable, with clearer responsibility separation and better error handling.
